# Check-It-PJT-112-Mobile

## App Overview

Checkit is an application that allows users to compare prices of a particular product from different vendors,
the user can then proceed to the vendors site and purchase the said product from the vendor.

When the user gets to the app, the system loads products from a particular vendor with the homepage containing a few of the products.
if the user clicks on any product on the homepage, the user would be taken to the compare page where the price of the product can be compared with the price from other vendors. The user can navigate to the all products page where the user can see a more detailed description of the product on hover and also compare the price of the product with prices from other vendors by clicking on the particular product.

## Product Features

- A search field linked to filter the products by name or title on the homepage and by categories on the all products page
